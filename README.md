# TABDANCE (Table Data Syncer)

Tabdance is a library that maintain and manage latest data.

Main Feature compares the .csv data stored in the database with the .csv file in local repository and if they are different, update the table with the latest data. (In this case, the latest data is the data in local repository)

Local repository must exist files, .csv, .meta, .td. <br>
(If any of the three files is not exist, it will not be updated)

- `.csv`: .csv file is the data file you want to maintain and manage.
- `.meta`: .meta file is a json file in which the table name where the csv should be saved is written.
  - .meta file name must be the same as the .csv file name
  - `column_match` is an optional value.
  Set `column_match` when csv header and table column are different.
  - An error occurs if the `csv_header` is not in the .csv file or the `table_column` is not in the .td file.
  ```json
  {
    "table_name": "table_name",
    "column_match": {
      "csv_header": "table_column",
      ...
    }
  }
  ```
- `.td`: .td file is a json file in which table schema definitions(column name, coulmn type) are written. 
  - .td file name must be the same as the table name
  ```json
  {
    "columns": [
      {
        "name": "column_name1",
        "type": "int4",
        "primary_key": "boolean"
      },
      {
        "name": "column_name2",
        "type": "varchar(255)"
      },
      ...
    ]
  }
  ```

There is one .td file per table, and multiple .csv files can be entered in one table. In this case, .meta files are created as many as the number of .csv files, and one .td file is created.

Additional Feature is that data files can be uploaded and downloaded by ssh connection between local repository and remote repository.
